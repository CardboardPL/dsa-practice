# DSA Practice
This repo will serve as a place to practice and internalize DSA concepts.

## Naming Convention
### Practice Problems
File names for files in /problems and its subdirectories will follow this template:\
`(difficulty)_(problem name)_(problem source).(language extension)`

Example:\
`easy_shortestPathInGrid_ai.js`
In this example, we can see that:
- The difficulty is easy
- The problem name is shortestPathInGrid
- the problem source is ai (artificial intelligence)
- the language extension is js

In summary:
| Part | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Difficulty** | The difficulty of the challenge | `easy` |
| **Problem Name** | The name of the problem | `shortestPathInGrid` |
| **Problem Source** | The source of the problem | `ai` |
