/* Problem Description
Problem: Shortest Path in a Grid
Constraints:
- You have a 2D grid of size m x n.
- Each cell is either:
    - 0 -> empty (can walk through)
    - 1 -> obstacle (cannot walk through)
- You start at the top-left cell (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1).
- You can move up, down, left, or right (no diagonals).
- Grid size: 2 <= m <= 10, 2 <= n <= 10

Goal: 
- Find the minimum number of steps to reach the bottom-right cell.
- Return -1 if there's no valid path.
